description: >
  Compilation fails because a variable is declared more than once
  within the same scope.

root_cause:
  summary: Duplicate variable declaration
  details: >
    The same variable name is declared multiple times in the same scope.
    In C++, variables must be declared once and reassigned if needed.

resolution:
  strategy: manual
  risk_level: low
  steps:
    - "# Identify the original variable declaration"
    - "# Example:"
    - "# int a = 5;"

    - "# Do not redeclare the variable in the same scope"
    - "# Incorrect:"
    - "# int a = 7;"

    - "# Correct approach: assign a new value"
    - "a = 7;"

verification:
  success_criteria:
    - compilation succeeds
    - no redeclaration errors reported
