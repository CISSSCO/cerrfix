description: >
  YAML parsing fails because a colon (:) is used inside a value
  without proper quoting, causing the parser to interpret it as
  a new key-value separator.

root_cause:
  summary: "Unquoted colon in YAML value"
  details: >
    In YAML, the colon character (:) is reserved for defining
    key-value mappings. When a colon appears inside a value
    without quotes, the YAML parser throws a ScannerError.

resolution:
  strategy: manual
  risk_level: low
  steps:
    - "# Identify the line mentioned in the error message"
    - "# Example: line 25, column 24"

    - "# Quote any value containing a colon (:)"
    - "# Example:"
    - "# summary: \"Missing std:: namespace\""

    - "# Alternatively, use block scalar syntax"
    - "# Example:"
    - "# summary: >"
    - "#   Missing std:: namespace"

    - "# Avoid leaving trailing colons in unquoted values"
    - "# Incorrect: summary: Missing std:"
    - "# Correct  : summary: \"Missing std:\""

verification:
  success_criteria:
    - YAML file loads successfully with yaml.safe_load
    - cerrfix add-fix or update-fix completes without error
