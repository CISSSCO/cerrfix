description: >
  Linking fails with undefined reference errors for C++ standard library symbols.

root_cause:
  summary: C++ standard library not linked
  details: >
    The program was compiled or linked using gcc instead of g++,
    or the C++ standard library was not linked explicitly.

resolution:
  strategy: manual
  risk_level: low
  steps:
    - "# Check how the program was compiled"
    - "grep -n gcc build.log"

    - "# Recompile using g++ instead of gcc"
    - "g++ main.cpp -o app"

    - "# If linking manually, explicitly link stdc++"
    - "gcc main.o -lstdc++ -o app"

verification:
  success_criteria:
    - application links successfully
    - "no undefined reference to std::"
