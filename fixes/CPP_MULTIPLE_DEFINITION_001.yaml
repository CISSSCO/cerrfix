description: >
  Linker reports multiple definitions of the same symbol.

root_cause:
  summary: Function or variable defined multiple times
  details: >
    This often occurs when functions are defined in header files
    without using inline or include guards.

resolution:
  strategy: manual
  risk_level: medium
  steps:
    - "# Check headers for function definitions"
    - "grep -R \"{\" include/"

    - "# Move function definitions to source (.cpp) files"
    - "# Keep only declarations in headers"

    - "# Use include guards or #pragma once in headers"
    - "# Example: #ifndef HEADER_H"

verification:
  success_criteria:
    - linking completes without multiple definition errors
