title: "Assignment to const (read-only) variable"

category: programming
subcategory: cpp
severity: error
confidence: high

scope:
  machine: generic
  environment: linux
  os: generic

error_signature:
  type: regex
  pattern: "assignment of read-only variable"

description: >
  Compilation fails because a variable declared as const
  is being assigned a new value after initialization.

root_cause:
  summary: "Variable declared const but later modified"
  details: >
    In C++, variables declared with the const qualifier
    become read-only after initialization. Any attempt
    to modify them results in a compilation error.

resolution:
  strategy: manual
  risk_level: low
  steps:
    - "# Locate the variable declaration"
    - "# Example:"
    - "# const int a = 5;"

    - "# Do NOT assign a new value to a const variable"
    - "# Incorrect: a = 7;"

    - "# Option 1: Remove const if modification is required"
    - "# int a = 5;"

    - "# Option 2: Initialize const variable with correct value"
    - "# const int a = 7;"

    - "# Option 3: Use a separate mutable variable"
    - "# int b = a;"
    - "# b = 7;"

verification:
  success_criteria:
    - compilation succeeds without errors
    - no assignment to const variables remains
