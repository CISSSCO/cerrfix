* Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to *cerrfix* 🎉

*cerrfix* is a community-driven project aimed at capturing and
structuring solutions to *common errors on Linux-based systems* in a
transparent, auditable, and extensible way.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- New fix definitions
- Improvements to existing fixes
- Bug reports
- Feature enhancements
- Documentation improvements

---

* Contribution Philosophy

Before contributing, please keep the following principles in mind:

- *Safety over automation*: Never introduce fixes that perform
  destructive system changes automatically.
- *Transparency*: All fixes must be human-readable and auditable.
- *Portability*: Avoid assumptions about a specific distribution,
  cluster, or organization.
- *Minimalism*: Keep fixes and logic simple and explicit.

---

* Ways to Contribute

** Improve Existing Fixes

You may:
- Refine regex patterns
- Improve descriptions or titles
- Add clearer resolution steps
- Improve verification criteria

Always ensure backward compatibility and avoid breaking existing fixes.

---

** Report Bugs or Issues

If you encounter:
- False positives
- Missed detections
- Validation failures
- CLI bugs

Please open an issue with:
- Exact command used
- Relevant error logs (sanitized)
- Expected vs actual behavior

---

* Fix Definition Guidelines

When writing fix YAML files:

- Use a *globally unique* `issue_id`
- Prefer *regex patterns* that are specific but robust
- Keep resolution steps *explicit and safe*
- Avoid hardcoded paths or environment-specific values
- Prefer generic solutions with clear user guidance

Fixes must validate against the official schema.

---

* Development Setup

** Requirements

- Linux
- Python >= 3.8
- pip or conda environment

** Local Setup

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cerrfix
python -m venv .cerrfix-env
source .cerrfix-env/bin/activate
pip install pyyaml
#+END_SRC

---

* Code Style & Standards

- Follow the existing project structure
- Keep functions small and readable
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid introducing breaking changes without discussion
