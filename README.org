* Overview

*cerrfix* is a lightweight, extensible command-line tool designed to
help users and system administrators diagnose and resolve *common errors
on Linux-based systems*.
It works by matching known error signatures from logs against a curated,
human-readable knowledge base of fixes and presenting safe, actionable
solutions.

The tool is intentionally *non-intrusive* and *transparent*, making it
suitable for personal machines, servers, development environments, and
shared systems.

---

* Motivation

Linux systems frequently encounter recurring problems such as:
- Compiler and linker errors
- Missing headers and shared libraries
- Runtime loader failures
- Permission and execution issues
- Environment and path misconfigurations

While solutions often exist, they are:
- Repeated across users and cattered across forums, emails, or chat logs
- Poorly documented or forgotten over time

*cerrfix* converts this operational knowledge into a structured,
searchable, and reusable fix repository.

---

* Key Features

- Rule-based error detection using regex patterns
- YAML-based fix definitions
- Human-readable and auditable fixes
- Optional fix script generation
- CLI-first design (no background services)
- Works across diverse Linux environments
- Extensible fix repository without code changes
